# JeepWranglerCANBusID217
Challenge:  The 2011 Jeep Wrangler lights an amber gas pump icon when the system identifies 50 miles of travel remaining based on fuel level and driving history - it's not easy to see and I ran out of gas a couple of times.
Project Goal: interface with the 2011 Jeep Wrangler CAN message bus, identify the message indicating fuel level, and determine how to build a better heads-up! before I start running on Fumes.
Hardware: Arduino Uno, SparkFun CAN shield, 16x2 cheap LCD display, DB9 serial bus cable, pencil and paper.
