Let's pull CAN message ID #217 (Fuel level indication) from the 2011 Jeep Wrangler!
Challenge:  The 2011 Jeep Wrangler lights an amber gas pump icon when the system identifies 50 miles of travel remaining based on fuel level and driving history.  I ran out of gas a couple of times, and would like a better warning before the fat lady sings.
Project Goal: interface with the 2011 Jeep Wrangler CAN message bus, identify the message indicating fuel level, and determine how to build a better gas gauge for the "fumes" region.  
Hardware: Arduino Uno, SparkFun CAN shield, 16x2 cheap LCD display, DB9 serial bus cable, pencil and paper.
